## Data Connection and Initial Setup
- **Data Connection:** Begin by connecting to COVID-19 vaccination data, typically stored in a CSV file.
- **Dashboard Objective:** Outline the dashboard's primary goal to track global vaccine progress and understand COVID-19's impact worldwide.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Develop KPIs such as:
- **Partially Vaccinated:** Utilize Tableau's tools to display individuals with one dose of the COVID vaccine.
- **Fully Vaccinated:** Showcase data regarding individuals who have completed their vaccination regimen.
- **Unvaccinated Percentage:** Calculate and display the percentage of the population not vaccinated.
  
## Visualizing Vaccination Data
- **Country-wise Analysis:** Generate visual representations of vaccination status across different countries.
- **Bar Charts:** Utilize bar charts to illustrate partially and fully vaccinated individuals per country.
- **Sorting and Formatting:** Sort countries based on vaccination percentages and enhance visual appeal with color and text formatting.
  
## Mapping Vaccination Rates
- **Utilizing Maps:** Incorporate geographical representations to display vaccination rates.
- **Geographical Data:** Use country data to generate a world map displaying vaccination rates per 100 individuals.
- **Color Coding:** Apply suitable color schemes for clear interpretation of vaccination rates.
  
## Analyzing Correlations
- **GDP and Vaccination Correlation:** Explore the relationship between a country's GDP per capita and vaccination rates.
- **Data Analysis:** Use GDP data alongside vaccination rates to establish correlations.
- **Trend Analysis:** Implement trend lines to showcase how GDP impacts vaccination rates.
  
## Dashboard Integration
- **Dashboard Creation:** Integrate all visual elements into a cohesive dashboard.
- **Widget Placement:** Arrange widgets systematically for easy comprehension.
- **Filter Integration:** Implement filters for user interaction and data exploration.
  
## Dashboard Finalization and User Interaction
- **Customization:** Fine-tune dashboard aesthetics and functionalities.
- **Formatting:** Ensure a visually appealing layout and colour scheme.
- **Interactive Elements:** Enable filters for user-driven exploration and data selection.

## Conclusion
We've walked through the steps to build an informative dashboard tracking global COVID-19 vaccination efforts. Visualizing immunization data by country and GDP provides insights to guide equitable vaccine administration.
